# Advent of Code 2021
These are my codes and answers to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

My goal this year is to just try to complete the puzzles, so I'm doing them in TypeScript, a language that I'm familiar with. Don't expect really good and/or optimized algorithms: AoC for me is just a way to learn and practice coding. Also, I cannot resist a puzzle hunt, hahaha!

BUT, if you are searching for really cool and well done Python resolutions for the puzzles, check out [Ç´abriel Kanegae's AoC 2021 repository](https://github.com/KanegaeGabriel/advent-of-code-2021). He is a great programmer, a really special friend and my inspiration to participate. He also solved all the previous puzzles; all of them are linked in the page.

So, good luck getting stars, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
